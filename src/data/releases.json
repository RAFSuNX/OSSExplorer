      "body": "This release looks minor at the surface, however, the entire codebase has gone through significant refactoring and migration. The native code in Magisk used to be mainly C++, but several contributors and I have been steadily rewriting parts of the code in Rust since April 2022. After years of effort, the Rust-ification of the project slowly began picking up steam, and at the moment of this release, over 40% of the native code has been rewritten in Rust, with several major subsystem rewrites in the PR queue, planned to be merged for the next release.\r\n\r\nMany might wonder, why introduce a new language to the project? My reason is actually not to reduce memory safety issues (although it is a nice side benefit), but to be able to develop Magisk using a more modern programming language. After using Rust for a while, it's clear to me that using Rust allows me to write more correct code and makes me happier compared to dealing with C++. People share the [same sentiment as I do](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1577667445719912450.html).\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n- [General] Massive internal refactoring and code migration\r\n- [App] Support downloading module zip files with XZ compression\r\n- [App] Disable app animations when system animations are disabled\r\n- [MagiskMount] Support systemlessly deleting files with modules using blank file nodes\r\n- [MagiskInit] Redesign sepolicy patching and injection logic\r\n- [MagiskSU] Better TTY/PTY support\r\n\r\n### Full Changelog: [here](https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/changes.html)\r\n",

      "body": "### Changes from v26.0\r\n\r\n- [App] Fix crashing when revoking root permissions\r\n- [MagiskInit] Always prefer `ext4` partitions over `f2fs` when selecting the pre-init partition\r\n- [General] Restore module files' context/owner/group from mirror. This is a regression introduced in v26.0\r\n\r\n(The following is the same as v26.0 release notes)\r\n\r\nHey! Long time no see!\r\n\r\n### Bumping Minimum Android Version to 6.0\r\n\r\nMagisk's support for Android Lollipop has been pretty broken for a while without it being noticed. Also, none of the active developers of Magisk have actual hardware to run Android Lollipop. We rely on using the official Android emulator for regression testing on older platforms, however Google never shipped a Lollipop emulator image with SELinux support, leaving us with no option but to drop Lollipop support since we don't feel comfortable supporting Android Lollipop without adequate testing.\r\n\r\n### New Magic Mount Implementation\r\n\r\nMagic Mount, the feature that make modules modify partitions, has gone through a major rewrite. The existing implementation doesn't work well with OEMs injecting overlays into their system using `overlayfs`. The new implementation fundamentally changes how filesystem mirrors are created, giving us a more accurate clone of the unmodified filesystem.\r\n\r\n### New `sepolicy.rule` Implementation\r\n\r\nMagisk allows modules to provide custom SELinux patches by including the file `sepolicy.rule`. Due to the complicated nature of SELinux patching, the compatibility of this functionality has been pretty spotty; many devices are not supported. In this release, a brand new pre-init partition detection mechanism has been designed to support even more devices.

      "body": "Hey! Long time no see!\r\n\r\n### Bumping Minimum Android Version to 6.0\r\n\r\nMagisk's support for Android Lollipop has been pretty broken for a while without it being noticed. Also, none of the active developers of Magisk have actual hardware to run Android Lollipop. We rely on using the official Android emulator for regression testing on older platforms, however Google never shipped a Lollipop emulator image with SELinux support, leaving us with no option but to drop Lollipop support since we don't feel comfortable supporting Android Lollipop without adequate testing.\r\n\r\n### New Magic Mount Implementation\r\n\r\nMagic Mount, the feature that make modules modify partitions, has gone through a major rewrite. The existing implementation doesn't work well with OEMs injecting overlays into their system using `overlayfs`. The new implementation fundamentally changes how filesystem mirrors are created, giving us a more accurate clone of the unmodified filesystem.\r\n\r\n### New `sepolicy.rule` Implementation\r\n\r\nMagisk allows modules to provide custom SELinux patches by including the file `sepolicy.rule`. Due to the complicated nature of SELinux patching, the compatibility of this functionality has been pretty spotty; many devices are not supported. In this release, a brand new pre-init partition detection mechanism has been designed to support even more devices. Due to complicated reasons, this detection mechanism cannot be performed in a custom recovery environment.\r\n\r\n**This means that any installation of Magisk v26+ using custom recovery will be incomplete; a subsequent re-installation through the Magisk app after booting up is required.**\r\n\r\n### Zygisk Updates\r\n\r\n**The new Zygisk API v4 is now live!** It comes with new features and a refined PLT function hook API.

A lot of the changes aren't visible at the surface, but v25 is actually a really substantial upgrade!\r\n\r\n### MagiskInit Rewrite\r\n\r\nA significant portion of `magiskinit` (the critical software that runs before your device boots up) is completely rewritten from scratch. Ever since Android introduced [Project Treble](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html) in Android 8.0, Magisk has been constantly fighting against the increasingly complex partitioning and early mount setups of all kinds of devices, sometimes with weird OEM specific implementations. It got to a point that `magiskinit` had become so complicated that few people (including myself!) were aware of every detail, and maintaining this piece of software like this was clearly not sustainable. After many months of planning (yes, this whole re-architecture has been in my head for a long time) and some help from external contributors, a whole new `sepolicy` injection mechanism is introduced into Magisk, solving the \"SELinux Problem\" once and for all.\r\n\r\nSince this is a full paradigm shift on how Magisk hot-patch the device at boot, several behaviors that many developers implicitly relied on might not exist. For example, Magisk no longer patches fstabs in most scenarios, which means AVB will remain intact; some custom kernels rely on AVB being stripped out for them by Magisk.\r\n\r\n### MagiskSU Security Enhancements\r\n\r\nThe superuser functionality of Magisk has not seen much changes ever since its introduction. v25 focuses on making root permission management more accurate and secure:\r\n\r\n- Add a whole new package tracking system to ensure malicious UID reuse attack cannot be performed\r\n- Properly support and implement the UX in the Magisk app for packages using `sharedUserId`\r\n- Enforce root manager APK signature verification to combat the rampant unofficial Magisk app \"mods\"\r\n\r\nMany might not realize, but using a trusted, unmodified Magisk app is really important. Magisk's root daemon treats the Magisk app differently and gives it blanket root access without any restrictions. A modded Magisk app can potentially backdoor your device.\r\n\r\nAnd in case some of you are about to put on your tin foil hats, this is not designed to \"vendor lock-in\"; the goal is to make sure your root management app comes from the same developer of the underlying root implementation. Magisk's build system allows custom distributors to use its own signing keys, and in addition, I am also providing official debug builds which skips any signature verification for development.\r\n\r\n### Full Changelog: [here](https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/changes.html)\r\n",
